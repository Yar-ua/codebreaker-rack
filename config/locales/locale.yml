    Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code
    created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application
    weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.
    <br/>
    The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).
    <br/>
    In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess
    with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces. A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers
    in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.
    <br/>
    For example:
    <br/>
    Secret number - 1234
    <br/>
    Input number - 6264
    <br/>
    Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)
    <br/>
    A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers
    in the secret code but in a different position.
    <br/>
    For example:
    <br/>
    Secret number - 1234
    <br/>
    Input number - 6462
    <br/>
    Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)
    <br/>
    An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.
    <br/>
    If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.
    <br/>
    If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses. 0Codebreaker also has some number of hints
    (depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code."
